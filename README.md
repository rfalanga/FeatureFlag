# FeatureFlag

With this repo I intend to demonstrate saving feature flags in local storage. This is an ASP.NET MVC app.

## Using the latest stable versions

I had originally decided to use the preview version of some packages, such as Microsoft.FeatureManagement. However, I have decided to use the latest stable versions of the packages.

## .NET 

Upgraded to .NET 10 on 1/31/2026.

## Borrowing from another repo

I am borrowing from [fffffatah's getting-features-from-database-example](https://github.com/fffffatah/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/tree/fffffatah/getting-features-from-database-example/examples/GettingFeaturesFromDatabase).
I've attributed the code that I've borrowed from that repo.
